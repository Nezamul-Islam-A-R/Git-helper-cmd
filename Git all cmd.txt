==============================================================
git init (initialize Git -> create a repository)
git add (add a new file in git & to make ready to push in git)
git status (shows current status of files)

pwd -> print working directory
ls (show file)
ls -a (all file with hidden file show)
cd /C/
cd Users/
cd 'N. I. M. Ashafuddula'
cd Desktop/

clear

git init
git add --all
git commit -m "msg" file name (commit file)
git commit -am "msg" file1 name file2 name (commit all file)
git commit -am "all2Commit"



====================================Hosting (Push -Pull)
[1] <For new Project cmd>
-> go to website
-> create a repository
-> [https / SSH] url Copy. (https://Ashaf_razon@bitbucket.org/Ashaf_razon/testgit.git)
-> git clone key (will create a blank project)
-> cd testgit (now we can work here)

[2] <if there is any project on local PC>
-> goto existing project directory (which is initialized already) cd ../ testGit (folder name)
git remote add origin (add remote) (name can be any) url (https://Ashaf_razon@bitbucket.org/Ashaf_razon/testgit.git)
git remote remove origin (remove origin url)

git remote show (who how many remote added <may have many remote>)
git remote show origin (shows URL)
git push origin master (push)
git push origin master -f (push)
git pull origin master (pull) 

git diff file.txt (what changed)
git diff myTestGit.txt myTestGit.txt
git diff *

***UserName (bitbucket username)
***pass (bitbucket Pass)

->PROBLEM (PUSH) in the case of rejecting & first facing 

git fetch && git checkout master

git fetch origin master
git merge origin master
git push origin master

git log (shows log)
git show key(log) (shows commit with message, we can see every changes)

->Git reset & Amend

git log
git show (log Key) (The state we want to back)
git checkout (log Key) (Full project in git in that state)
git checkout master (back to head/ means back to origin/previous state)

cat filename.txt (shows content of the file)

->only single file to previous state
git checkout 4b73 (log key) myTestGit.txt (back this filte into that log state)
git checkout master -f (for only one file back master state)

->RESET
(Never reset after PUSH to remote)
[1] Soft reset (remove only that commit, work/ commit after that commit will be remain same as before)
<Keep changes and back>
git reset --soft 3833c (Log Key)
git diff HEAD (see changes)

[2] Hard reset (remove commit after that key & that text and back)
<clean all changes and back>
git reset --hard 3833c (Log Key)

git reflog (show what we have done till now)
git reset HEAD@{0} (back previous HEAD)
git reset --hard (Back previous head)

-> if ther are 2 files and need to commit both same time but we commited only one file
so, there we will use Ammend instead of commit.

git commit --amend
git commit --amend -m "update commit 2 files"
